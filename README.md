# InventoryManagementSystem

This is an inventory management/tracking system written using the .NET Framework Windows Forms Application, written entirely in C#.  It utilizes collection classes, abstract classes, and inheritance.  You can add/delete products and parts to the system, and can add/remove parts to the existing products in the system.  It does not store any permanent data, and is loaded with "dummy" data for you to play around with.

You can download and install the stand alone application onto your computer by going to this link. You'll need to select download anyway and/or ignore any warning your computer may give you.
